<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My Name is Jesse Cordova, and I live in San Antonio Tx. Some of my favorite
  hobbies include playing guitar and photography. Specifically film photography.
  When I am not working or furthering my education in web design and development
  I am out in the streets photographing people. I enjoy getting sun walking
  around photographing people interacting with each other. When I am not doing
  photography I am playing guitar. I enjoy playing my favorite songs as well as
  creating my own music.

  I am currently learning Web Design and Development with Anegela Yu's Udemy
  course. I have to say ive learned alot and she is a great teacher. Ive always
  been curious about the process of building websits and publishing them on the
  world wide web. I also look forward to being able to eventually be able to
  create my own websites and put them on the web for everyone to see. I enjoy
  the process and creativity that goes into building websites and look forwatrd
  to learning more.

<p>
  My goal is to one day be able to pursue a job in Web Design and Developing, Be
  that through a company or on my own. I currently work as a dispatcher for a
  maintenance company and enjoy my job. Although I enjoy job I would like to
  make a career switch building websites. I look forward to gaining more
  confidence and expanding my knowledge so that I can create more opprotunities
  for myself in the tech field.
